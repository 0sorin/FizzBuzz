# FizzBuzz
Fizz Buzz game implemented with division rules:
- a number divisible by 3 will return Fizz
- a number divisible by 5 will return Buzz 
If there are multple division rules that match for a number it will return the combined result for the division rules: e.g.: divisible by 3 and 5 will return FizzBuzz

It can be extended to any division by implementing the IDivisible interface and adding the division rule to the FizzBuzz game
